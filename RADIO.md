## I have a song that I wish to be played!
Awsome, and we will love to play it!  Please read the next two sections.

### Song Submission Terms and Conditions:

We want to make sure that we stream all music legally.  Please note the following conditions before submitting music to be added to the playlist.
 * All submitted music must be either public domain or under a Creative Commons License.  The main reason for this is we don't want to deal with licensing, copyright, and all that nonsense.  Having the music be CC or Public Domain makes our lives easier, and reduces our risk having problems.
 * Submitted music can NOT be under a Non-Commercial CC license.  Although we do not (and do not currently plan to) monitize the live stream, we may become YouTube partners in the future.  May be a legal gray-area where our videos are montized, but our stream is not.  Not worth the risk.
 * Submitted music can NOT be under a NoDerivs CC license.  We do take the submitted music and add our visuals to it so it can be streamed out.  Even though the music itself WILL NOT change, one could argue that the act of adding the visuals creates a derivative work, and we can't do that if there's a no derivative restriction on it.  Again, just not worth the risk.
 * Submitted music will have the song title, artist, album name, license, album art (if any), and website info appear in the stream.
 * Your submission will be played as many (or as few) times as needed.
 * Your submission can be thrown out of our playlist for any reason, at anytime, and without warning.
 * Your submission can be rejected for any reason.

### How to submit songs
 * Read the Terms And Conditions Above.
 * Create a GitHub account (they're free).
 * Submit an issue at: [https://github.com/MeditationEnthusiasts/Tasks/issues/new](https://github.com/MeditationEnthusiasts/Tasks/issues/new)
 * In the title, put "[Song Submission]" first, and then the title of the song
 * In the description (where it says "Leave a comment") include the following:
   * Webpage to download the song from (website should also include the license information.  If we can't find any, we'll reject the submission).
   * We'll rip the song name, artist, album name (if any), album art from the audio file's meta data.  If there is no metadata, we'll take the information from the website.  If there is no information on the website link, please include the the information in the comments, or the song may be rejected.
 * Hit "Submit Issue."  We'll let you know if we added the song to the playlist or not.
